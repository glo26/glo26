Hi there! Glo here, I'm currently working on projects related to agent security, spatial intelligence, and process automation. My current projects: **[StepShield](https://github.com/glo26/stepshield)** - benchmark for detecting rogue behaviors in AI agents during code execution | [AtlasPro AI](https://github.com/AtlasPro-AI) - spatial intelligence layer for critical infrastructure.
