Hi there! Glo here, I'm currently working on projects related to agent security, spatial intelligence, and process automation. My main projects are [AtlasPro AI](https://github.com/AtlasPro-AI) - the spatial intelligence layer for critical infrastructure + **[StepShield](https://github.com/glo26/stepshield)** - an AI safety/security benchmark for detecting rogue behaviors in AI agents during code execution.
