Hi there! Glo here, I'm currently working on projects related to agent security, spatial intelligence, and process automation. My most recent project is: **[StepShield](https://github.com/glo26/stepshield)** - an AI safety/security benchmark for detecting rogue behaviors in AI agents during code execution. I also run [AtlasPro AI](https://github.com/AtlasPro-AI) - we're currently exploring ways to make AI agents spatially smarter!
